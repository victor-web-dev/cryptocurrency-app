### About Electron

There's no hard setup. Electron is configured to open a window with the resolution of _1280x720_.
It uses _localhost_ to load the page, because of that it needs to reactjs to be working.
All of that can be seen in the main.js file inside [/electron](/electron/)

Any further explanation about electron and how it works can be checked in their [website](https://www.electronjs.org/)
